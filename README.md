# ComposePluginSystem

This is my test of a plugin implementation supporting with Jetpack Compose. You can also do the same with XML, like doing plugin activity or etc.
Just because Jetpack Compose is easier and more suitable for handling plugin systems.

## Usage

1. Download the `ExamplePlugin.apk` in [Actions](../../actions), and put it into `$external/ComposePluginSystem/plugins/` directory.
2. Install and launch the ComposePluginSystem (`app-debug.apk`) app in [Releases](../../releases), and press the CheckBox to load the compose view provided by the `ExamplePlugin`.

## Disclaimer

I am a beginner of Jetpack Compose, perhaps this is not a perfect way to easily implement a plugin system. If you have any further ideas, or improvements. Feel free to let me know.
